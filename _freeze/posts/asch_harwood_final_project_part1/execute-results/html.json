Collectively,\nU.S. residents and businesses throw out roughly 90 million tons of food\nannually, contributing nearly 5 percent of the total net US greenhouse\ngas emissions.\n\nCreating system-level estimates in the food supply chain is notoriously\ndifficult. To produce these estimates, ReFED employs a 'mass balance'\naccounting approach. For each sector, ReFED estimates the value of the\ntotal supply of food in US dollars. It then applies a price per lb\nconversion factor to convert dollars to tons to estimate the total suppy\nof food in weight. ReFED then draws on academic and private-sector\nstudies to determine 'surplus rates'--the share of food that is not\ngoing to its intended destination. The supply of food is multiplied by\nthese surplus rates to determine the total amount of surplus food in a\ngiven place and year.\n\nA limitation of this approach, however, is that the research to estimate\nsurplus rates is rarely, if ever, repeated at regular intervals. As a\nresult, the lack of year-over-year and geographic variation in surplus\nrates makes it incredibly difficult to identify systematic changes in\nthe food waste behaviors.\n\n# Proposal\n\nMy goal is to develop a cost-effective and maintainable model to\nestimate per capita food waste in the United States in a given year. I\nhypothesize that per capita food waste is a function of the current\nsupply of available food combined with corporate and consumer knowledge,\nattitude, and beliefs about climate change. I believe food supply is an\nimportant explanatory variable for two reasons: 1)food waste is always a\nshare of food supply and there is always a minimum amount of food needed\nto feed the population, and 2)it is standard at food business to have on\nhand more food than meets demand, which means that supply frequent\noutstrips demand, leading to food waste. However, I also believe that\nconern about climate-related issues is an important predictor. In\nparticular, I hypothesize that greater concern for climate-related\nissues correlates with reduced food waste when controlling for issue\nlike population. The logic is that if folks are more concerned with\nclimate-issues, then they are more likely to try and 'right-size' the\namount of food that is produced on the supply chain side and purchased\non the consumer side.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we need a ground truth of food waste. The best\npublicly available direct measurement of food waste tends to be waste\ncharacterization studies. State and local governments periodically\nconduct inferential waste characterization studies, where they randomly\nselect typically a series of 200 - 300 lb samples from landfills and\nother waste management facilities across several seasons in a year, and\nseparate the garbage to determine the weight and composition of\nmunicipal solid waste in a particular area over a predetermined time.\nThese studies are then used to set waste management budgets,\n'right-size' landfill capacity, and create/evaluate programs meant to\ndivert recyclable and compostable materials from landfills. These\nstudies are some of the best sources 'direct measurement\n\nHowever, they are not conducted regularly or consistently (or at all in\nmany places), and, to my knowledge, there are no\nnationally-representative waste characterization studies. The dominant\napproach, employed by the Environment Protection Agency and the United\nStates Department of Agriculture use these studies to produce national\nfood waste estimates. But they approach is to simply take just a handful\nof these publicly available studies, calculate a per capita estimate for\nthe study, and then scale that number by the current calendar year\npopulation size.\n\nNevertheless, I believe there is the potential to creatively use these\nstudies to estimate the share of food waste in landfills at the\nnational-level over time, and, hopefully, to determine if there are any\nsystematic changes in food waste management behavior in the commercial\nand residential sectors.\n\n### Research Questions\n\n1.  How much food is currently wasted on a per capita basis in the\n    United States?\n\n2.  What factors explain differences in waste between states and over\n    time?\n\n3.  How do food waste estimates produced using a bottom-up method\n    proposed here compare to top-down, mass balanced-based approaches?\n\n### Independent/Dependent Variables\n\n**Food Supply**\n\n-   As a proxy for food supply, which is quite difficult to measure, I'm\n    utilizing supermarket revenue data by state from the years 2005 -\n    2021, which I extracted from Ibisworld State Industry reports. I\n    then converted this measure to a state per capita basis. Note that\n    in order to cover the missing years from 2000 - 2005, I fit a linear\n    regression based on state, population, and year. However, this is\n    meant to be a placeholder for the sack of this exercise. In future\n    iterations, I plan to use data from 2005 to present.\n\n**Consumer Knowledge**\n\n-   As a proxy for consumer knowledge, I extracted state-level search\n    volume for the topic, \"Climate Change\", using Google Trends\n    Supercharged, which provides absolute search volumne from 2004 to\n    present. I then converted this measure to a state per capita basis.\n    To fill missing years 2000 - 2003, I also fit a linear regression to\n    serve as placeholder. Again, for future iterations, I plan to use a\n    baseline of 2005.\n\n**Corporate Knowledge**\n\n-   As a proxy for corporate knowledge/concern about climate changed, I\n    extracted state-level search volume for the topic, \"Sustainability\",\n    using Google Trends Supercharged. I then converted this measure to a\n    state per capita basis. To fill missing years 2000 - 2003, I also\n    fit a linear regression to serve as placeholder. Again, for future\n    iterations, I plan to use a baseline of 2005.\n\n**Consumer Corporate Knowledge Interaction**\n\n-   I included an interaction term between sustainability and climate\n    change search volume. My argument for doing so is that they are\n    meant to represent the 'supply' and 'demand', which hypothetically\n    influence each other. While the sustainabilty search was the only\n    statistically significant of the two search variables, adding the\n    interaction term increased the overall R-squared as well as the\n    adjusted r-squared.\n\n**Food Waste**\n\n-   For the dependant variable, food waste per capita, I extracted\n    absolute food waste weights from 20 state-level municipal solid\n    waste characterization studies as well as the sample sizes collected\n    to produce each of those calculations. I then calculated food waste\n    per captia. Give the small size of this dataset, I mutiplied the\n    sample size for each observation by the population in the respective\n    state, which I then used as weights in the model.\n\n### Control Variables\n\n**Year** - I wanted to control for the impact of change over time\nbecause estimates from other models (i.e. ReFED) show a general increase\nin food waste over time.\n\n**Population**\n\n-   I control for population in two different ways - using per capita\n    measures and including population as a control variable. Per capita\n    metrics do not fully capture the influence of population, which\n    hypotehtically should correlate with changes in food waste.\n    Controlling for population increased the coefficients for my two\n    statisitcally significant explanaotry variables as well as the\n    multiple and adjusted r-squared.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n**Food Supply**\n\nH0: Supermarket revenue is not correlated with per capita food waste\n\nH1: Increased supermarket revenue is correlated with increased per\ncapita food waste\n\n**Consumer Knowledge**\n\nH0: Google search volume about 'climate change' is not correlated with\nper capita food waste\n\nH1: Google search volume about 'climate change' is negatively correlated\nwith per capita food waste\n\n**Corporate Knowledge**\n\nH0: Google search volume about 'sustainability' is not correlated with\nper capita food waste\n\nH1: Google search volume about 'sustainability' is negatively correlated\nwith per capita food waste\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nCurrently, no comprehensive aggregate municipal solid waste\ncharacterization datasets exisit for the United States in the public\ndomain. To address this, I have compiled roughly 300 waste\ncharacterization studies, of which I have parsed and coded roughly 50 to\ndate, based on the following (rough) criteria[^1]. To be eligible to be\nincluded in my dataset, each study must be:\n\n[^1]: I recognize that we were encouraged to work with pre-existing\n    datasets. Nevertheless, I view this as an opportunity to prototype a\n    project I believe might have real-world applicability in my\n    professional life.\n\n-   conducted in the United States and be representative of the state,\n    county, or local level between the years of 2000 and 2021\n-   infer the amount of total food as a share of the total amount of\n    municipal solid waste for an entire year\n-   report the number of samples, which need to be between 200 - 300 lbs\n    each\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwaste =

log(sustainability search volume)is associated with a -0.31%\n    decrease in total food per capita, holding all other variables\n    constant. This is a negative relationship, indicating that as\n    interest in sustainability increases, total food waste per capita\n    decreases. This finding is statistically significant.\n\n2.  **`log(gt_abs_cc_per_capita)`**: A 1% increase in log(climate change\n    search volume) is associated with a 0.11% increase in total food\n    waste per capita, holding all other variables constant.
